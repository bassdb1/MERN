Create a database called 'my_first_db'.

Create students collection.

Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, num_oscars: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})


// Create 5 Students with the appropriate info.

db.students.update({_id: ObjectId("609eb4e56059de83f87f82e7")}, {$push: {interests: "Mustangs"}})



Remove the 'relaxing' interest you just added.

db.actors.update({_id: ObjectId("609ea3f3e3e6e14666e80d73")}, {$pop: {interests: 1}})
